OVERVIEW OF PROJECT

Student Grade Tracker
This Java program calculates the total marks, percentage, and grade of a student based on the marks obtained in multiple subjects. The program ensures valid input by checking that the marks are within the range of 0 to 100 and handles cases where an invalid number of subjects or marks is entered.

Features:
User Input Validation: Ensures that the number of subjects and marks entered are valid.
Dynamic Calculation: The program dynamically calculates the total marks, percentage, and corresponding grade based on the number of subjects entered.
Grading System: Assigns grades based on the percentage:
A+ : 90% and above
A : 80% to 89%
B : 70% to 79%
C : 60% to 69%
D : 50% to 59%
F : Below 50%
How to Use:
Run the program.
Enter the total number of subjects.
Enter the marks obtained in each subject.
The program will display the total marks, percentage, and grade.

This  project serves as a great starting point for understanding basic Java programming concepts such as loops, conditionals, and user input handling.
